The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model and a Shiny app that is able to predict the next word of a user's input. A slide deck was also required to pitch the algorithm and app using R Studio Presenter.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available in the "project_app" folder on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abeasock/Capstone-Coursera.git) responsitory for this course.

Final Report is available in this repository in the project_app folder [final.md](https://github.com/abeasock/Capstone-Coursera/blob/master/project_app/final.md#id-2.6%20-%20Data%20Visualizations)

R presentation for pitching the app is available also available on my [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/abeasock/capstone_presentation)

The Shiny App is available at: https://amberbeasock.shinyapps.io/capstone_app/
