# How To Use App

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This word prediction app has been developed for the Data Science Capstone course from Coursera by John Hopkins University in partnership with Swiftey.

The app may take up to 30 seconds to initalize for the first time. An initializing message will display in the upper right to show the loading progress. Once this reaches 100% it will disappear and you may begin using the app."

The user must type in at least two words before hitting "Submit". The user's inputed words will be run through the developed prediction model.

The top three words with the highest probability of being the next word will be displayed. If the prediction model is unable to make a prediction then the message "No prediction found" will appear in the Prediction output box.
